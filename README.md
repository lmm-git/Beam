Beam
====

Please note: This software is curerently under development and there aren't all required software at the moment!

Requirements (hardware)
-----------------------
* Computer at the Beamer: We develop our controller on a Raspberry Pi Version B Rev. 2 (with ethernet, 512MB RAM and Raspian). We use the GPU for display videos, so if you want to use another computer you should be sure that mplayer can decode all videos you wish.
* Beamer: It's planned to control beamers with PJLink. For stages it would be great thet the beamers have a shutter.
* Server: A fast running Apache, a MySQL database, running PJLink on server and the Zikula Application Framework (perfectly installed ;) ).
* Clients: Clients should have a easy webbrowser to access the internal Zikula site.
* A fast network to connect all (as best a own subnet).
We suggest to use Raspian for your Rasperry Pi's and Ubuntu for your clients/thin clients and main server.



More information coming soon.
