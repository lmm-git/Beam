Beam
====

Please note: This software is curerently under development and there aren't all required software at the moment!

Requirements (hardware)
-----------------------
* Computer at the Beamer: coming soon
* Beamer: It's planned to control beamers with PJLink. For stages it would be great thet the beamers have a shutter.
* Server: A fast running Apache, a MySQL database, running PJLink on server and the Zikula Application Framework (perfectly installed ;) ).
* Clients: Clients should have a easy webbrowser to access the internal Zikula site.
* A fast network to connect all (as best a own subnet).

We suggest to use Ubuntu for your clients/thin clients and main server.



More information coming soon.
